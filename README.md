## Background
There are too many companies that are using Workday as their job board. I have seen that the pattern for all these jobs is 90% similar, and applying on Workday is a real pain in the a**. 
It mandates you to log in which requires signup and it never segregates the candidate's profile, your profile is limited to a company and is not carried forward to any other company. Not sure why all MNCs are onboarding to Workday. 

I have thought to put my profile in a JSON file and apply to all the jobs through a Python script. So, far it worked for me like a charm. 

If you too think it benefits you then please feel free to use and suggest any modifications.
